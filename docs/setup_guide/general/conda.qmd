In order to develop on **FIAT** locally, the Python package manager **Miniforge3** is recommended.

Download and install [Miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge)

Initialize conda by running the following in the Miniforge prompt:

```bash
conda init
```

Depending on your computer settings, you might also have to run the following in a Powershell terminal as administrator:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
