title: "Installing FIAT"
---

## For Use
FIAT can be installled in an existing environment or the user can create a new environment. We recommened to create a new environment to avoid issues with other dependencies and packages.

### New environment
To create a new environment follow the steps below.

- Create a new environment:

    `conda create -n fiat python=3.11.*`

- Activate the environment:

    `conda activate fiat`

- Install FIAT from Github. After creating the new environment, you need to install all dependencies from the Deltares Github repository. You can use **pip install** to do so:

    `pip install git+https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT.git`

### Existing environment
If you want to install FIAT into an existing environment, simply activate the desired environment and run:

`pip install git+https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT.git`


## For Development
This is for those who wish to contribute to the development of FIAT.

- First, clone the FIAT repository on Github into a local directory of choice:

    `cd ~/{your path}`

    `git clone https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT.git fiat`

- Create a new development environment. Make sure you either have tomli or tomllib (build-in with Python 3.11) in your base enviroment. Go into your cloned FIAT repository folder and create the environment file by running the *make_env.py* script:

    `cd ~/{your path}/fiat`

    `python make_env.py dev`

- Then, create and activate the new environment in conda:

    `conda env create -f environment.yml`

    `conda activate fiat_dev`

- To install all the required dependencies, run:

    `pip install -e . `

There you go. FIAT is now installed on your local machine for development purposes.
